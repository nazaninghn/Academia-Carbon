## How to Use

### In the Application

1. Go to **Data Entry**
2. Select **🇹🇷 Turkey** from country dropdown
3. All calculations automatically use **2025 factors**
4. Results show reference source for transparency

### Example Calculation

**Electricity consumption: 1,000 kWh**

```
2023: 1,000 × 0.486 = 486 kg CO2e
2024: 1,000 × 0.468 = 468 kg CO2e
2025: 1,000 × 0.452 = 452 kg CO2e

Savings: 34 kg CO2e (7% reduction)
```
